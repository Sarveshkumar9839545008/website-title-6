                <p>
                    Fellow Citizens, It is a day of immense pride and joy as we commemorate the historic moment when India’s Constitution came into effect on January 26, 1950, marking the country’s transition to a sovereign, democratic, and republic state.
                    This day holds profound significance in the hearts of every Indian, as it symbolises the culmination of our hard-fought struggle for independence and the dawning of a new era of hope, equality, and justice.
